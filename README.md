# MASTER THESIS CODE

Code for the data processing and data analysis of my thesis: Comparison of statistical methods for analysing data coming from a high throughput phenotyping platform: Aeroponics at the UCL.

The code is presented as a map of the different scripts, then a detailled explanation of the folders, scripts, datasets and what they contain.

## Project roadmap 
In this section, the project roadmap is presented in different sections that correspond to experimental planning, data processing, data analysis, data visualization. In each section the analysis performed, with the intented goals, is described. A more detailed explaination of the scripts is presented the *Scripts explanation* section.

## Scripts explanation
Before starting, it is important to specify that data visualization from each part of the project (design, results, ...) are always created at the end of the related script and not in a separate script on the side. This section explains each script in details, specifying which data are used as inputs, are outputted, and which plot are being created.
