	abstract = {Given the rapid development of plant genomic technologies, a lack of access to plant phenotyping capabilities limits our ability to dissect the genetics of quantitative traits. Effective, high-throughput phenotyping platforms have recently been developed to solve this problem. In high-throughput phenotyping platforms, a variety of imaging methodologies are being used to collect data for quantitative studies of complex traits related to the growth, yield and adaptation to biotic or abiotic stress (disease, insects, drought and salinity). These imaging techniques include visible imaging (machine vision), imaging spectroscopy (multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing), thermal infrared imaging, fluorescence imaging, 3D imaging and tomographic imaging (MRT, PET and CT). This paper presents a brief review on these imaging techniques and their applications in plant phenotyping. The features used to apply these imaging techniques to plant phenotyping are described and discussed in this review.},

Phenotypic variation is produced through a complex web of interactions between genotype and environment, and such a ‘genotype–phenotype’ map is inaccessible without the detailed phenotypic data that allow these interactions to be studied. Despite this need, our ability to characterize phenomes — the full set of phenotypes of an individual — lags behind our ability to characterize genomes. Phenomics should be recognized and pursued as an independent discipline to enable the development and adoption of high-throughput and high-dimensional phenotyping.},

The goal is to provide quantitative analyses of plant structure and function relevant for traits that help plants better adapt to lowinput agriculture and resource-limited environments. We provide an overview of the inherently multidisciplinary research in plant phenotyping, focusing on traits that will assist in selecting genotypes with increased resource use efﬁciency. We highlight opportunities and challenges for integrating noninvasive or minimally invasive technologies into screening protocols to characterize plant responses to environmental challenges for both controlled and ﬁeld experimentation. Although technology evolves rapidly, parallel efforts are still required because large-scale phenotyping demands accurate reporting of at least a minimum set of information concerning experimental protocols, data management schemas, and integration with modeling. The journey toward systematic plant phenotyping has only just begun.},

In an effort to overcome this, a fully automated robotic ﬁeld phenotyping platform with a dedicated sensor array that may be accurately positioned in three dimensions and mounted on ﬁxed rails has been established, to facilitate continual and high-throughput monitoring of crop performance. Employed sensors comprise of high-resolution visible, chlorophyll ﬂuorescence and thermal infrared cameras, two hyperspectral imagers and dual 3D laser scanners. The sensor array facilitates speciﬁc growth measurements and identiﬁcation of key growth stages with dense temporal and spectral resolution. Together, this platform produces a detailed description of canopy development across the crops entire lifecycle, with a high-degree of accuracy and reproducibility.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing (RS) of plant canopies permits non-intrusive, high-throughput monitoring of plant physiological characteristics. This study compared three RS approaches using a low ﬂying UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle), with that of proximal sensing, and satellite-based imagery. Two physiological traits were considered, canopy temperature (CT) and a vegetation index (NDVI), to determine the most viable approaches for large scale crop genetic improvement. The UAV-based platform achieves plot-level resolution while measuring several hundred plots in one mission via high-resolution thermal and multispectral imagery measured at altitudes of 30–100 m. The satellite measures multispectral imagery from an altitude of 770 km. Information was compared with proximal measurements using IR thermometers and an NDVI sensor at a distance of 0.5–1 m above plots. For robust comparisons, CT and NDVI were assessed on panels of elite cultivars under irrigated and drought conditions, in different thermal regimes, and on un-adapted genetic resources under water deﬁcit. Correlations between airborne data and yield/biomass at maturity were generally higher than equivalent proximal correlations. NDVI was derived from high-resolution satellite imagery for only larger sized plots (8.5 × 2.4 m) due to restricted pixel density. Results support use of UAV-based RS techniques for high-throughput phenotyping for both precision and efﬁciency.},

	abstract = {Background:  To our knowledge, there is no software or database solution that supports large volumes of biological time series sensor data efficiently and enables data visualization and analysis in real time. Existing solutions for manag‑ing data typically use unstructured file systems or relational databases. These systems are not designed to provide instantaneous response to user queries. Furthermore, they do not support rapid data analysis and visualization to enable interactive experiments. In large scale experiments, this behaviour slows research discovery, discourages the widespread sharing and reuse of data that could otherwise inform critical decisions in a timely manner and encour‑age effective collaboration between groups.
Results:  In this paper we present SensorDB, a web based virtual laboratory that can manage large volumes of biological time series sensor data while supporting rapid data queries and real-time user interaction. SensorDB is sen‑sor agnostic and uses web-based, state-of-the-art cloud and storage technologies to efficiently gather, analyse and visualize data.
Conclusions:  Collaboration and data sharing between different agencies and groups is thereby facilitated. SensorDB is available online at http://sensordb.csiro.au.},

Crop yield and quality are affected by climate change directly, and indirectly, through diseases that themselves will change but remain important. These effects are difficult to dissect and model as their mechanistic bases are generally poorly understood. A combination of integrated modelling from different disciplines and multi-factorial experimentation is needed to advance our understanding and prioritisation of the challenges. This will help prioritise breeding objectives. Food security brings in additional socio-economic, geographical and political factors. Enhancing resilience to the effects of climate change is important for all these systems and functional diversity, particularly in tolerance traits for abiotic and biotic stress, is one of the most effective targets for improved sustainability.},

	abstract = {Low-rank smoothing techniques have gained much popularity in non-standard regression modeling. In particular, penalized splines and tensor product smooths are used as flexible tools to study non-parametric relationships among several covariates. The use of standard statistical software facilitates their use for several types of problems and applications. However, when interaction terms are considered in the modeling, and multiple smoothing parameters need to be estimated standard software does not work well when datasets are large or higher-order interactions are included or need to be tested. In this paper, a general approach for constructing and estimating bivariate smooth models for additive and interaction terms using penalized splines is proposed. The formulation is based on the mixed model representation of the smooth-ANOVA model by Lee and Durbán (in press), and several nested models in terms of random effects components are proposed. Each component has a clear interpretation in terms of function shape and model identifiability constraints. The term PS-ANOVA is coined for this type of models. The estimation method is relatively straightforward based on the algorithm by Schall (1991) for generalized linear mixed models. Further, a simplification of the smooth interaction term is used by constructing lower-rank basis (nested basis). Finally, some simulation studies and real data examples are presented to evaluate the new model and the estimation method.},

	abstract = {In designed experiments and in particular longitudinal studies, the aim may be to assess the effect of a quantitative variable such as time on treatment effects. Modelling treatment effects can be complex in the presence of other sources of variation. Three examples are presented to illustrate an approach to analysis in such cases. The first example is a longitudinal experiment on the growth of cows under a factorial treatment structure where serial correlation and variance heterogeneity complicate the analysis. The second example involves the calibration of optical density and the concentration of a protein DNase in the presence of sampling variation and variance heterogeneity. The final example is a multienvironment agricultural field experiment in which a yield-seeding rate relationship is required for several varieties of lupins. Spatial variation within environments, heterogeneity between environments and variation between varieties all need to be incorporated in the analysis. In this paper, the cubic smoothing spline is used in conjunction with fixed and random effects, random coefficients and variance modelling to provide simultaneous modelling of trends and covariance structure. The key result that allows coherent and flexible empirical model building in complex situations is the linear mixed model representation of the cubic smoothing spline. An extension is proposed in which trend is partitioned into smooth and non-smooth components. Estimation and inference, the analysis of the three examples and a discussion of extensions and unresolved issues are also presented.},

This paper examines methods of smoothing fertility trends in field trials using the P-spline. We begin by smoothing trend within block and for each block, and proceeds to demonstrate how it can be extended to smooth trends in trials with two-dimensional setting. We propose simultaneous modelling of trends and local variation. We use Papadakis [J.S. Papadakis, Comparison de differentes methds d'expermentation phytotechnique, Rev. Argen. Agronom. 7 (1940), pp. 297–362.] and kriged covariate to model local variation. We emphasize on the benefit of using P-spline to compromise between parametric and non-parametric approaches. Data sets from wheat and barley trials, designed as randomized complete block design and row-column, are analyzed. We set out a simple strategy of choosing between additive model and two-dimensional setting. We explore different estimation methods and offer some generalizations. The results show importance of the P-spline in modelling trend and the need to choose between additive and two-dimensional settings.},

But although DF describes the complexity of the whole fitted model, in general it remains unclear how to allocate DF to individual effects. Here we present a new definition of DF for arbitrary normal-error linear hierarchical models, consistent with that of Hodges and Sargent, that naturally partitions the n observations into DF for individual effects and for error. The new conception of an effect’s DF is the ratio of the effect’s modeled variance matrix to the total variance matrix. This provides a way to describe the sizes of different parts of a model (e.g., spatial clustering vs. heterogeneity), to place DF-based priors on smoothing parameters, and to describe how a smoothed effect competes with other effects. It also avoids difficulties with the most common definition of DF for residuals. We conclude by comparing DF with the effective number of parameters, pD, of Spiegelhalter et al. (2002).

Numerical difficulties in estimation and interpretation of these models may occur when the autocorrelation parameter ρ tends to either zero or unity. These problems are considered here using three different examples. The first example is based on simulated data for a partially replicated design, where the true underlying variance-covariance structure is known. The other two examples involve real data from a precision farming trial and a plant breeding trial. We suggest four options to deal with the observed numerical problems and illustrate their use with the examples. It is shown in the examples that re-scaling of the spatial coordinates or a re-parameterization of the AR(1) model as an exponential model can be useful to help the model converge. We conclude that individual parameter estimates of the AR(1) model should be interpreted with care, especially when the autocorrelation estimate is close to either zero or unity. © CBCS 2015.},

We applied genotyping-by-sequencing, a recently developed method to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms, in the genomes of 384 wheat (Triticum aestivum) genotypes that were field tested under three different water regimes in Mediterranean climatic conditions: rain-fed only, mild water stress, and fully irrigated. We identified 102,324 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in these genotypes, and the phenotypic data were used to train and test genomic selection models intended to predict yield, thousand-kernel weight, number of kernels per spike, and heading date. Phenotypic data showed marked spatial variation. Therefore, different models were tested to correct the trends observed in the field. A mixed-model using moving-means as a covariate was found to best fit the data. When we applied the genomic selection models, the accuracy of predicted traits increased with spatial adjustment. Multiple genomic selection models were tested, and a Gaussian kernel model was determined to give the highest accuracy. The best predictions between environments were obtained when data from different years were used to train the model. Our results confirm that genotyping-by-sequencing is an effective tool to obtain genome-wide information for crops with complex genomes, that these data are efficient for predicting traits, and that correction of spatial variation is a crucial ingredient to increase prediction accuracy in genomic selection models.},

	abstract = {El desarrollo de gran parte de los modelos y métodos estadísticos ha ido ligado al deseo de estudiar aplicaciones específicas dentro de diversos ámbitos científicos. El análisis de datos de naturaleza espacial y espacio-temporal es en la actualidad de gran interés para la modelización estadística. Problemas relacionados con la metereología, la contaminación medioambiental, la ecología, la epidemiología o la economía, demandan el uso de modelos estadísticos para el análisis de datos espaciales y espacio-temporales. En el primer capítulo de esta tesis, introducimos los conceptos básicos de la estadística espacial, así como la clasificacióon de los datos espaciales según su tipología y una revisión de los modelos tradicionales en la literatura con sus principales limitaciones. En esta tesis proponemos la modelización de este tipo de datos mediante modelos de regresión no-paramétricos, también denominadas técnicas de suavizado. Nuestra propuesta es considerar la modelización desde una perspectiva común para los diferentes tipos de datos espaciales, mediante el uso de los denominados splines con penalizaciones (P-splines). Estos modelos han adquirido una gran popularidad en los últimos años ya que: (i) se tratan de suavizadores de rango bajo, ya que se construyen a partir de bases para la regresión de (B-splines) menor tamaño que el número de datos, que son computacionalmente más eficientes que otros métodos de suavizado basados en splines; (ii) la formulación como modelos mixtos permite incorporar estructuras más complejas en términos de efectos aleatorios que pueden estimarse simultáneamente al suavizado. El segundo capítulo está enteramente dedicado a introducir los aspectos fundamentales de la metodología de los P-splines, para datos Gaussianos y en el contexto de los modelos lineales generalizados para el caso de datos no-Gaussianos. Para el caso multidimensional, la base para la regresión se define como el producto Tensorial de las bases de B-spline marginales, que en el caso de datos en grids o mallas multidimensionales es el producto de Kronecker de las matrices de B-spline. En esta situación, el uso de los métodos de array permite el ajuste de los modelos de manera computacionalmente eficiente. Presentamos también en detalle la representación como modelo mixto, y los métodos de estimación. Aunque esta representación no es nueva en la literatura de los splines, nuestra reparametrización de las bases y de la penalización del modelo permite la decomposicionn del ajuste en términos de la suma de funciones marginales e interacciones. Por último en este capítulo, adaptamos los algoritmos basados en arrays para la formulación como modelo mixto. En el tercer capítulo, extendemos los modelos de P-splines para el suavizado de datos espaciales. La estructura de los datos espaciales requiere del uso de un nuevo producto Tensorial, el producto de Kronecker por filas. En este caso, los métodos de arrays no son aplicables, y la reparametrización como modelo mixto no es inmediata, sin embargo demostramos cómo se puede llegar a ella mediante resultados matriciales. Ilustraremos la metodología para la tipología de datos y ejemplos de datos espaciales introducidos en el primer capítulo. Como aplicación de la metodología propuesta en este capítulo, abordamos el análisis de datos regionales de conteo. Los datos de conteo se asumen distribuidos según una variable aleatoria Poisson, sin embargo, este supuesto resulta en ocasiones erróneo cuando los datos presentan una variabilidad heterogénea no explicada (sobre-dispersión). Como resultado de este capítulo, en Lee y Durbán (2009), analizamos los datos de cáncer de labio en Escocia. Estos datos han sido muy utilizados en la literatura de los modelos para datos regionales, sobre todo desde el enfoque de los modelos condicionalmente autorregresivos (CAR). En este trabajo proponemos modelos de suavizado híbridos que permiten incorporar diferentes fuentes de variabilidad espacial: (i) una variabilidad espacial a gran escala, capturada por el spline, y (ii) una varibilidad local a pequeña escala dada por la estructura de vecindad de las regiones del estudio, con una estructura tipo CAR. La ventaja de nuestro modelo híbrido, es que ambas fuentes se pueden estimar simultánemente. Los estudios de simulación realizados corroboran que el modelo híbrido permite capturar las diferentes fuentes de variabilidad en los escenarios propuestos. En el cuarto capítulo, consideramos el caso multidimensional mediante la descomposición de los modelos como la suma de funciones de suavizado, en términos de efectos principales o aditivos e interacciones (estos modelos son denominados modelos de suavizado ANOVA, por su analogía a los diseños factoriales y análisis de la varianza). La construcción de estos modelos mediante bases de B-spline, sufre de problemas de identificabilidad dado que no se pueden estimar de manera única. Nuestra solución para evitar estos problemas es la reparametrización como modelos mixto desarrollada en los capítulos anteriores. Esta reparametrización permite identificar cuáles son los elementos que aparecen repetidos, la solución al problema se reduce por tanto a eliminar los componentes repetidos, lo cual permite de manera sencilla construir la nueva base y la penalización para el modelo identificable. Lo interesante de este sencillo procedimiento es su equivalencia a imponer restricciones lineales sobre los coeficientes del modelo original. El estudio de simulación presentado en este capítulo, demuestra que el modelo de suavizado ANOVA actúa bajo los escenarios considerados del mismo modo que el modelo más apropiado para cada caso. En algunas situaciones, resulta de interés considerar tan sólo algunos efectos principales e interacciones e ignorar otros. Estos modelos, reciben el nombre de modelos reducidos de suavizado ANOVA. Un ejemplo es el caso espacio-temporal, donde resulta de interés la decomposición del proceso en términos de la suma de una superficie espacial, una función suave para el componente temporal, y un componente espacio-temporal que recoge la interaccióon espacio-tiempo. Para el caso espacio-temporal, construiremos las bases para la regresión mediante el producto de Kronecker de las bases de B-spline espacial y temporal, lo cual permite para este caso utilizar los métodos de array definidos en los capítulos anteriores. Siguiendo el procedimiento desarrollado en este capítulo, demostramos cómo construir los modelos e identificamos las restricciones sobre los coeficientes en el modelo original. Para ilustrar esta metodología en Lee y Durbán (2010), consideramos el uso de estos modelos para el análisis espacio-temporal de los niveles de ozono en Europa entre los años 1999 y 2005. Por último, en este capítulo, proponemos un método computacionalmente eficiente para el caso de modelos con interacción. En algunas situaciones, el tamaño de la matriz de B-splines para la interaccióon es muy grande, lo que conlleva a que la estimación de los parámetros sea computacionalmente intensiva. En el caso de los modelos de suavizado ANOVA, es posible asumir que la mayor parte de la estructura es recogida por los efectos principales, y por tanto es preferible reducir la complejidad del modelo reduciendo el tamaño de las bases de la interacción. Sin embargo, esta reducción no es arbitraria, puesto que de otro modo los modelos no estarían anidados. Nuestra propuesta es la construcción de bases anidadas de B-spline para las interacciones. En el caso espacio-temporal, esta solución permite modelizar la parte temporal con una base de más tamaño para recoger la estructura temporal de los datos, y una base anidada (mucho más pequeña), para modelizar la interacción espacio-tiempo. Finalmente, en el quinto capítulo resumimos las principales aportaciones realizadas en esta tesis, y proponemos posibles futuras extensiones a los modelos desarrollados y nuevas líneas de investigación.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------},

Such connections are at least a quarter of a century old but, perhaps with the advent of mixed model software, have led to a paradigm shift in the field of smoothing. The reason is that most, perhaps all, models involving smoothing can be expressed as a mixed model and hence enjoy the benefit of the growing body of methodology and software for general mixed model analysis. The handling of other complications such as clustering, missing data and measurement error is generally quite straightforward with mixed model representations of smoothing.},

	abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity in fields may affect the outcome of experiments. The conventional randomized allocation of treatments to plots may cause bias and variable precision in the presence of trends (including periodicity) and spatial autocorrelation. Agricultural scientists appear to mostly use conventional experimental designs that are susceptible to adverse affects from field variability. The objectives of this research were to (i) quantify the use of different experimental designs in agronomic field experiments, and (ii) develop spatially-balanced designs that are insensitive to the effects of both trends and spatial autocorrelation. A review was performed of all research efforts reported in Volumes 93–95 of the Agronomy Journal and the frequency of various experimental designs was determined. It showed that the vast majority (96.7\%) of agronomic field experiments are implemented through Randomized Complete Block (RCB) designs. The method of simulated annealing was used to develop Spatially-Balanced Complete Block (SBCB) designs based on two objective functions: promoting spatial balance among treatment contrasts, and disallowing treatments to occur in the same position in different blocks, when possible. SBCB designs were successfully developed for designs up to 15 treatments and 15 replications. Square SBCB designs were realized as Latin Squares, and perfect spatial balance was obtained when feasible. SBCB designs are simple to implement, are analyzed through conventional ANOVAs, and provide protection against the adverse effects of spatial heterogeneity, while randomized allocation of treatments still ensures against user bias.},

The average gain in efficiency was 119\% with maximum 128\%. Mean ranks comparison for both randomized complete block and alpha lattice design were performed. It was observed that the ranks were not constant across the experiments. The results emphasize that the traditional randomized complete block designs (RCBD) should be replaced by alpha lattice in the agricultural field experiments when number of varieties to be tested in an experiment increases to more than five or ten.

Soil survey maps may have up to 0.41ha inclusions of dissimilar soils within a mapping unit. The objectives of this study were to determine the degree of spatial variability of soil physical properties and variance structure, and to model the sampling interval of alluvial floodplain soils. Soil profiles (n ϭ 209) from 18 parallel transects were sampled with a mean separation distance of 79.4 m. Each profile was classified into surface, subsurface, and deep horizons. Structural analysis of soil bulk density (␳b), sand, clay, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), volumetric water content (␪v) at seven pressure potentials (⌿a) (Ϫ1, Ϫ10, Ϫ33, Ϫ67, Ϫ100, Ϫ500, and Ϫ1500 kPa) were modeled for the three horizons. Variance of soil physical properties varied from as low as 0.01\% (␳b) to as high as 1542\% (Ks). The LSD test indicated significant (P Ͻ 0.05) differences in sand, clay, ␳b, Ks, and ␪v at various ⌿a. Geostatistical analyses illustrated that the spatially dependent stochastic component was predominant over the nugget effect. Structured semivariogram functions of each variable were used in generating fine-scale kriged contour maps. Overall autocorrelation, Moran’s I, indicated a 400-m sampling range would be adequate for detection of spatial structure of sand, silt, clay, and a 100-m sampling range for soil hydraulic properties and ␳b. The magnitude and spatial patterns soil physical property variability have implications for variable rate applications and design of soil sampling strategies in alluvial floodplain soils.},

Tensiometers installed at 30.5, 61.0, 91.4, 121.9, 152.4, and 182.9 cm were used to measure hydraulic gradients. Soil-water contents were ascertained from soil-water characteristics obtained from six soil cores taken from each of the above depths for each plot. Variations in soil-water content were found to be normally distributed with depth and with horizontal distance throughout the field, while values of the hydraulic conductivity were found to be log-normally distributed. The correlation between hydraulic conductivity during steady-state infiltration and the clay fraction was significant at the 1 per cent level.

	abstract = {Data from three ryegrass spaced plant variety trials conducted at Crossnacreevy, Co. Down in each
of 1989, 1990 and 1991 were investigated for evidence of spatial dependence. Spatial dependence was
most evident in variates measuring the overall dimensions of the plants, especially late season
variates. However, the ‘date of ear emergence’ variate, which identifies most of the variety
distinctnesses that the trials are intended to detect, was not spatially dependent. On average, 45\% of
the residual variation in the plot means of the spatially dependent variates was estimated to be of a
spatial nature. Consequently, it is likely that the efficiency of analysis of these variates would be
improved by using spatial analysis instead of non-spatial analysis or by using alpha (incomplete
block) designs instead of complete block designs. The spatial information was used to determine the
optimal incomplete block sizes and the likely increase in efficiency due to using alpha designs instead
of complete block designs. The optimal incomplete block size for a trial with 10 plants per plot was
compared with the optimal incomplete block size for the same trial with single plant plots at the same
spacing and was found to be smaller. The gains in efficiency were larger in the trial with 10 plants per
plot than in the trial with single plant plots.},

If there are many posters and few reviews per judge, the commonly used balanced incomplete block design is not a feasible option. An additional challenge is an unknown number of judges before the event. We propose two connected near-balanced incomplete block designs that both satisfy the requirements of our setting: one that generates a connected assignment and balances the treatments and another one that further balances pairs of treatments. We describe both fixed and random effects models to estimate the population marginal means of the poster scores and rationalize the use of the random effects model. We evaluate the estimation accuracy and efficiency, especially the winning chance of the truly best posters, of the two designs in comparison with a random assignment via simulation studies. The two proposed designs both demonstrate accuracy and efficiency gain over the random assignment.},

	abstract = {In many areas of scientific research, complex experimental designs are now routinely employed. The statistical analysis of data generated when using these designs may be carried out by a statistician; however, modern statistical software packages allow such analyses to be performed by non-statisticians. For the non-statistician, failing to correctly identify the structure of the experimental design can lead to incorrect model selection and misleading inferences. A procedure, which does not require expert statistical knowledge, is described that focuses the non-statistician's attention on the relationship between the experimental material and design, identifies the underlying structure of the selected design, and highlights any potential weaknesses it may have. These are important precursors to the randomization and subsequent statistical analysis and can be easily overlooked by a non-statistician. The process is illustrated using a generalization of the Hasse diagram and has been implemented in a program written in R.},

This method generates a rich dataset containing morphological, topological and geometrical information of entire root systems grown in rhizotrons. The utility of the method is illustrated with a detailed architectural analysis of a 20-day old maize root system, coupled with a spatial analysis of water uptake patterns.},

	abstract = {BackgroundThe need to observe roots in their natural undisturbed state within soil, both spatially and temporally, is a challenge that continues to occupy researchers studying the rhizosphere.ScopeThis paper reviews how over the last 30 years the application of X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) has demonstrated considerable promise for root visualisation studies. We describe how early CT work demonstrated that roots could be visualised within soils, but was limited by resolution (ca. 1 mm). Subsequent work, utilising newer micro CT scanners, has been able to achieve higher resolutions (ca. 50 μm) and enhance imaging capability in terms of detecting finer root material. However the overlap in the attenuation density of root material and soil pore space has been a major impediment to the uptake of the technology. We then outline how sophisticated image processing techniques, frequently based on object tracking methods, have demonstrated great promise in overcoming these obstacles. This, along with the concurrent advances in scan and reconstruction times, image quality and resolution (ca. 0.5 μm) have opened up new opportunities for the application of X-ray CT in experimental studies of root and soil interactions.ConclusionsWe conclude that CT is well placed to contribute significantly to unravelling the complex interactions between roots and soil.},

	abstract = {[We identify three major components of spatial variation in plot errors from field experiments and extend the two-dimensional spatial procedures of Cullis and Gleeson (1991) to account for them. The components are nonstationary, large-scale (global) variation across the field, stationary variation within the trial (natural variation or local trend), and extraneous variation that is often induced by experimental procedures and is predominantly aligned with rows and columns. We present a strategy for identifying a model for the plot errors that uses a trellis plot of residuals, a perspective plot of the sample variogram and, where possible, likelihood ratio tests to identify which components are present. We demonstrate the strategy using two illustrative examples. We conclude that although there is no one model that adequately fits all field experiments, the separable autoregressive model is dominant. However, there is often additional identifiable variation present.]},

We also introduce a new graphical tool, the variance ratio fraction of design space (VRFDS) plot, which is useful for easy comparison of the prediction variance for competing designs over a given region of interest. Using the VRFDS plot to compare G-optimal designs to I-optimal designs shows that the G-optimal designs have higher prediction variance over the vast majority of the design region.

A theoretical explanation of these results is given. Part II describes a new method of NN analysis discovered by the first author and developed in collaboration with the co-authors. The method is essentially a "moving-block" analogue of classical forms of analysis for "fixed" blocks (or rows, columns). It avoids the defects of Papadakis's method and leads to approximately unbiased analyses. It is nearly always and often substantially more efficient on average than classical analyses of complete or incomplete block experiments, and also more efficient than standard analyses of Latin or lattice square designs if there are appreciable row × column interactions in the data. New criteria of design for NN balance are described. Validity of the new method under randomization is demonstrated empirically with Monte Carlo studies.]},

We examine an alternative approach in which the spatial heterogeneity is modeled directly. The model underlying our approach is similar to the model underlying a geostatistical kriging analysis and, as in the latter model, the observations are regarded collectively as a partial realization of a random field. A randomization study of uniformity trial data suggests that the random field approach often provides more accurate estimates of treatment contrasts than nearest-neighbor approaches. In addition, the random field approach is devoid of ambiguities as to the handling of border plots and is generally more flexible than nearest-neighbor approaches.]},

In practice these corrections turn out to be complicated, since there can be diﬀerent types of spatial eﬀects; those due to management interventions applied to the ﬁeld plots and those due to various kinds of erratic spatial trends. This paper presents models for ﬁeld trials in which the random spatial component consists of tensor product Penalized splines (P-splines). A special ANOVA-type reformulation leads to ﬁve smooth additive spatial components, which form the basis of a mixed model with ﬁve unknown variance components. On top of this spatial ﬁeld, eﬀects of genotypes, blocks, replicates, and/or other sources of spatial variation are described by a mixed model in a standard way. We show the relation between several deﬁnitions of heritability and the eﬀective dimension or the eﬀective degrees of freedom associated to the genetic component. The approach is illustrated with large-scale ﬁeld trial experiments. An R-package is provided.},
