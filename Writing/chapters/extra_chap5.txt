\section{EPPN 2020}
The EPPN2020 project is funded by Horizon 2020, a \Gls{EU} research and innovation program that aims at reducing the barriers to innovation and getting projects off the ground quickly \parencite{european_commission_horizon_nodate}. The project mainly focuses on increasing the interactions between actors of different communities and to provide access to a wide range of infrastructures, techniques and methods \parencite{european_commission_eppn2020_nodate}. EPPN2020 is set in the footsteps of the EPPN project, that lasted from 2012 to 2015 and focused on:
\begin{description}
\itemsep0em 
	\item[Transnational Access] 
		Access to 23 experimental phenotyping platforms.
	\item[Networking] 
		Consortium, events and workshops.
	\item[Join research activities] 
	Novel instrumentation, good practises and structures for common information technology for phenotyping.
\end{description}
\todo{Add the EPPN2020 goals here}

\subsection{Structure}
The EPPN2020 revolves around three goals:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Unifying phenotyping methods and novel technologies for environmental and plant measurements
	\item Provide good statistical methods and protocols for experimental design, data quality and statistical analysis
	\item Have a common European plant phenotyping information system.
\end{itemize}
To achieve these goals, the project has been divided into work-packages that each handle a specific aspect of the global task.
\subsubsection{JRA1: Creating novel techniques and methods for environmental and plant measurements}
The goal of this work-package is to increase reliability and consistency of environmental characterisation across platforms. This is achieved by determining the robustness of the available methods, by identifying the calibration procedures needed to correct the errors on the different platforms and by maximizing the effectiveness of the image-based method in high-throughput platform; by developing efficient image capture and analysis techniques.

\subsubsection{JRA2: Innovative design and analysis of phenotyping experiments across multiple platforms}
While the previous work-package is centred on data acquisition techniques, this one focuses on experimental design, data analysis and statistical methods. The first objective of the JRA2 package is to perform a statistical quality control and annotation protocols for phenotyping platform data. The second is to create statistical design and analysis for single and multiple platform experiments. This is achieved by designing efficient randomization scheme to minimize errors; and by creating mixed models and dynamic biological models to estimate and test genotypic treatment differences. Finally JRA2 is also about integration procedures for data from multiple platform and field experiments.

\subsubsection{JRA3: Building a consistent Information System in the different nodes and defining standardisation strategies }
JRA3 aims at building and integrating a compatible, consistent information system. This work-package provides methods and interfaces to manage, share, reuse and visualize heterogenous, high throughput plant phenotyping data stemming from different sources and/or in an interdisciplinary context. Another objective is to provide user friendly tools and a powerful environment beneficial to data analysis, integration and to the user communities.

\subsubsection{NA1: Management of Transnational Access}
This work-package has been created to facilitate the community access to all the existing facilities around Europe. All the installations of the network share a common set of characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Non-invasive high throughput phenotyping under controlled conditions
	\item Destructive sampling aiming at assessing underlying traits helping to understand the genetic variability of different plant processes
	\item Controlled field facilities allowing users to control and monitor external conditions with high-definition non-invasive sensors.
\end{itemize}
NA1 is there to ensure that the experiment proposals are technically feasible and that they represent a clear scientific questions, that has the potential to lead to promising results.
The proposal are reviewed by a board of scientists, independent from the EPPN2020 project.
 
\subsubsection{NA2: Networking}
NA2 aims at developing the community built around the project. To achieve this goals, they will enhance communication, networking and education between existing and new platforms, academic and industrial sectors and with other leading international phenotyping centres. The goal is to exchange knowledge on technologies, protocols and data acquisition. It will also improve international collaboration and illustrate the potential of the network for new-users.

\label{fig:EPPN2020_strucutre}
\end{figure}

Finally, as the figure \ref{fig:EPPN2020_strucutre} shows, a global work-package handles the management of the whole project. It works on three levels: a strategic one for unexpected situations; an operational one to ensure progress and conformity with the work plan; and a organisational one to optimise the infrastructural setup to support the project and manage the logistical issues.

\subsection{Protocols}

\section{UCL phenotyping platform}
\subsection{Infrastructures}
The root phenotyping platform at UCL handles 990 individual plants grown in two independent aeroponics boxes installed in a 64 sq-m G2 greenhouse. 495 plants circulate within each box (in the direction indicated by the orange arrow on figure \ref{fig:tank_aerial_view}), with a full revolution period of 2 hours, and are individually imaged by a high resolution line-scanner (720 DPI) that captures a single 2D projection of their root and shoot system. As seen on figure \ref{fig:tank_aerial_view}, the plants are held on strips, with 5 plants per strip. Concerning the nutrition, 3 sprinklers are placed regularly in the bottom of each side of the tank (fig. \ref{fig:tank_trans_view}). The sprinklers spray nutrient solution at regular interval, set by the operator. The spraying pattern (interval and duration) can be differentiated between day and night and can be modified at any moment of the experiment.\\

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Schematic views of an aeroponic tank in the UCL phenotyping platform}
    \label{fig:tank_schematic_view}
\end{figure}

Germination occurs within the system so that roots are never manipulated. Plants can be grown until the longest root is 60cm long, typically 2-3 weeks after germination. The image analysis pipeline processes individual images in less than one second and extract all tips coordinates, diameter and orientation. At the end of the experiment, the complete set of coordinates for each plant is used to reconstruct partial root trajectories and estimate growth rates and emergence for each root type \parencite{ippn_-_international_plant_phenotyping_network_emphasis_2015}.
\subsubsection{Sources of variation}
Several sources of variation are present in the installation. First and foremost, there is variation between the tanks. Secondly the heat distribution is heterogeneous in the greenhouse (fig. \ref{fig:tank_heating_system}), as the center is cooler than the sides due to the presence of heating pipes along the walls. Thirdly, due the disposition of the sprinkler in the bottom of the tank (fig. \ref{fig:tank_trans_view}), the plants on the outer parts of the strips may receive less nutrients than those in the center. No variations is excepted between the strips as they are continuously moving around the tank.
