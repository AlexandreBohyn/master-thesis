%Introduction
General ideas:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Genomics are evolving and phenotyping is not following
	\item Need for advances in phenotyping
	\item There's already progress in techniques: now data analysis
	\item we set up an experiment in the framework of the EPPN2020 
	\item Create our own design
	\item compare conditions in a specific platform
	\item Question: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Can we estimate genotypic differences
		\item Can we see the effects of the growing conditions (moving vs still)
		\item How do different spatial models compare
	\end{itemize}
	\item Own experiment to set-up + data collection : takes a lot of time
\end{itemize}
