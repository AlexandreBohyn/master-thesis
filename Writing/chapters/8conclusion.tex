%Conclusion
Goal of thesis not well met since unused data and untapped potential variables + not time evolution taken into account.

Spatial model unfit to moving environement but this environement was better for the platform.
However this could have been detected with GLMs.

Useful to compare to other trials with same genotypes and other trials on platform to if patterns are picked up.

No visible gradient on position
